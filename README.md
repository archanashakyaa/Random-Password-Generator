Description of the Code
This Python script generates a random password based on user-specified criteria for the number of letters, symbols, and digits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

Importing Modules:

The script begins by importing the string and random modules. The string module provides constants like ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation, while the random module provides functions for generating random choices.
Displaying Symbols:

symbols = string.punctuation assigns all punctuation characters to the variable symbols.
print(symbols) prints all available punctuation symbols to the console.
Displaying Letters and Numbers:

A loop iterates through ASCII values of uppercase and lowercase letters, printing each one.
Another loop iterates through ASCII values of digits (0-9), printing each one.
This is done for visual reference and does not affect the password generation.
User Input for Password Requirements:

The script prompts the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and digits they want in their password.
n_letter, n_symbols, and n_numbers store these user inputs as integers.
Generating the Password:

An empty list password_list is initialized to store the characters of the password.
A loop runs n_letter times, each time appending a random letter (uppercase or lowercase) to password_list.
Another loop runs n_symbols times, each time appending a random symbol from symbols to password_list.
A third loop runs n_numbers times, each time appending a random digit (0-9) to password_list.
Shuffling the Password List:

random.shuffle(password_list) shuffles the elements of password_list to ensure the characters are randomly ordered.
Converting List to String:

''.join(password_list) converts the shuffled list of characters into a single string password.
Printing the Generated Password:

print(f"Generated password: {password}") prints the final generated password to the console, formatted with a descriptive message.
